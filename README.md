## Description:
  I created this tool for the purposes of analyzing data with Jupyter. The goal was to import a list of names from another dataset, (we used a cleaned up IMDb list of actors), and look for missing details on either google or a specific website.
  In our case we were interested in the missing details of our cleaned dataset like age or ethnicity. With this tool we were able to fill in missing details and export as a dataset for final use in our data analyzation. 
 ## Problems:
One problem I ran into was network-timeout when working with larger datasets. This can be solved by running it in batches or by running it in the background. More details shared below.
## How to install:
  If you're interested in using this tool, you can simply clone or fork this repo, and run it off jupyter. I really recommend having Anaconda pre-installed.
